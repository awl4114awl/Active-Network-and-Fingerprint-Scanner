A modern Python application that performs **ARP-based network discovery** and **OS fingerprinting** using Nmap.  
This tool identifies active hosts on a subnet, retrieves their MAC addresses, and estimates operating systems using Nmap’s detection engine — all through a clean, dark-mode Tkinter GUI.

## ⚡ Features

### ✔ ARP-Based Network Scanning
- Discovers live hosts using Scapy ARP sweeps  
- Displays IP + MAC for each responding device

### ✔ OS Fingerprinting (Nmap)
- Uses: `nmap -O --osscan-guess --fuzzy`
- Identifies OS families, versions, and accuracy %

### ✔ Clean Dark-Mode User Interface
- Fixed 600×400 layout  
- Balanced columns  
- Scrollbar always visible  
- Buttons disable during scan to prevent thread conflicts

### ✔ User Experience Improvements
- Background thread scanning (no frozen UI)
- Progress bar + status footer
- “Ready”, “Scanning…”, “X devices found”
- CSV export option

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. Install Nmap (required)

Download for Windows:
[https://nmap.org/download.html#windows](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows)

Enable: **Add Nmap to PATH**

### 3. Install Npcap (required)

Download:
[https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/)

Enable: **WinPcap compatibility mode**

### 4. Run the app

```bash
python run.py
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Overview

### **Device Discovery (ARP Sweep)**

Uses a broadcast ARP request:

```python
Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff") / ARP(pdst=ip_range)
```

Hosts that respond are considered active.

### **OS Fingerprinting**

Runs:

```
nmap -O --osscan-guess --fuzzy <ip>
```

Parses:

* OS matches
* Accuracy values
* Best match selection

---

## 📤 CSV Export

Exports all discovered devices with:

| IP Address | MAC Address | Operating System |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- |

---

## 🛡 Disclaimer

Use this tool **only on networks you own or have explicit permission to scan**.
Unauthorized scanning may violate laws or policies.

---

## ⭐ Future Enhancements

* Multi-threaded OS scanning (faster scans)
* Network interface selection
* ICMP/TCP fallback for ARP-hidden devices
* Build as standalone `.exe`
* Integrated log window
