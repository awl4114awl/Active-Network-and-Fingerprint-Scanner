## 🪟 Overview

The **Active Network & Fingerprint Scanner** is a modern, dark-themed Windows desktop application built using **Python 3.14**, **Tkinter**, **Scapy**, and **Nmap**.
It provides a clean and efficient interface for performing network discovery and lightweight reconnaissance on any subnet you specify. This tool is part of my **cybersecurity & Python development portfolio** — demonstrating practical networking knowledge, GUI design, multi-threaded scanning workflows, and OS detection techniques used in real-world security assessments.

> ⚠️ Use this tool **only on networks you own or have explicit permission to scan.**
> Unauthorized scanning may violate laws, policies, or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

## ⬇️ Installation

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

**2. Install Nmap (required)**

Download for Windows:
[https://nmap.org/download.html#windows](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows)

_Enable: **Add Nmap to PATH**_

---

**3. Install Npcap (required)**

Download:
[https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/)

_Enable: **WinPcap compatibility mode**_

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

_The GUI should open._

## ❓ How the Scanner Works

The application performs a full **Layer-2 → Layer-7 device discovery workflow** using a combination of **Scapy** and **Nmap**.
Here’s the under-the-hood exact sequence:

---

**1. ARP Sweep (Network Discovery)**

When you enter an IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`), the tool sends a broadcast:

```
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff → ARP → Who has 192.168.1.X?
```

Every device that exists on that subnet responds with:

* **Its IP address**
* **Its MAC address**

This identifies all *alive* devices **without sending any TCP/UDP traffic**, meaning it's:

* Fast
* Low-noise
* Not blocked by firewalls

---

**2. Device Table Population**

Each responding device is immediately inserted into the GUI with:

* IP Address
* MAC Address
* Placeholder text: `Resolving OS…`

This makes the UI feel responsive even before OS detection finishes.

---

**3. OS Fingerprinting via Nmap**

For every discovered device, Nmap is invoked with:

```
-O --osscan-guess --fuzzy
```

Nmap analyzes:

* TCP/IP stack behavior
* Sequence prediction patterns
* Window size
* TTL characteristics
* Specific port responses

Then returns the best match:

```
"Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accuracy)"
"Windows 10 1607 – 21H2 (97% accuracy)"
"Apple iOS 15 – 16 (100% accuracy)"
"Fortinet Firewall (97% accuracy)"
```

This gives a **high-accuracy OS fingerprint**.

---

**4. Real-Time UI Updates**

As each fingerprint resolves, the row in the GUI updates *in place*:

* No freezing
* No blocking the main thread
* OS results appear one-by-one

The progress bar runs until all devices are processed.

---

5. Optional CSV Export

When the scan finishes, results can be exported:

```
IP Address, MAC Address, Operating System
192.168.1.116, 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8, Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accurate)
...
```

Perfect for documentation, inventory, or a portfolio showcase.

## 📤 Output Overview — What You Can Expect to See

When you run the **Active Network & Fingerprint Scanner**, the application performs two major actions:

### **1. ARP Sweep (Fast Device Discovery)**

The scanner quickly identifies devices on your subnet using ARP broadcasting.

You will immediately start seeing rows populate with:

| IP Address    | MAC Address       | Operating System |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 192.168.1.113 | 90:8D:6E:56:15:10 | Resolving OS…    |
| 192.168.1.116 | 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8 | Resolving OS…    |

### **2. OS Fingerprinting (Slower / In-Depth)**

For each discovered device, Nmap runs:

```
-O --osscan-guess --fuzzy
```

As results come in, the "Operating System" column updates in real-time:

| IP Address    | MAC Address       | Operating System                           |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 192.168.1.113 | 90:8D:6E:56:15:10 | Unknown                                    |
| 192.168.1.116 | 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8 | Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accurate)           |
| 192.168.1.123 | A0:85:FC:DD:98:6A | Fortinet FortiGate Firewall (97% accurate) |
| 192.168.1.152 | F0:EF:86:16:CF:C9 | Google Home device (100% accurate)         |

### **Status Footer**

At the bottom you get clear status updates:

```
Ready.
Scanning…
9 devices found • Scan completed in 14.2s
```

### **CSV Export Output**

Exporting results generates a clean CSV file:

```
IP Address,MAC Address,Operating System
192.168.1.113,90:8D:6E:56:15:10,Unknown
192.168.1.116,4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8,Linux 3.2–4.14 (100% accurate)
192.168.1.123,A0:85:FC:DD:98:6A,Fortinet FortiGate Firewall (97% accurate)
```

### **Expected Real-World Results**

Depending on your network, the scanner will identify:

* Windows 10 / 11 machines
* macOS clients
* iOS & Android devices
* Routers & firewalls (e.g., FortiGate, UniFi, TP-Link)
* Smart home devices (Google Home, IoT, cameras)
* Linux servers or embedded OSes

OS detection accuracy varies. Some devices confidently report at 100%, others remain `"Unknown"` due to manufacturer restrictions or closed network stacks.
