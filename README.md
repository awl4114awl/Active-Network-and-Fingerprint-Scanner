# Active Network & Fingerprint Scanner

## ⓘ Overview

The Active Network & Fingerprint Scanner is a modern, dark-themed Windows desktop application built using Python 3.14, Tkinter, Scapy, and Nmap.
It provides a clean and efficient interface for performing network discovery and lightweight reconnaissance on any subnet you specify. This tool is part of my cybersecurity & Python development portfolio — demonstrating practical networking knowledge, GUI design, multi-threaded scanning workflows, and OS detection techniques used in real-world security assessments.

> ⚠️ Use this tool only on networks you own or have explicit permission to scan.
> Unauthorized scanning may violate laws, policies, or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

## Features

* Discovers live hosts using Scapy ARP sweeps
* Displays IP + MAC for each responding device
* Uses: `nmap -O --osscan-guess --fuzzy`
* Identifies OS families, versions, and accuracy %
* Buttons disable during scan to prevent thread conflicts
* CSV export option

## Installation

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

2. Install Nmap (required)

Download for Windows:
[https://nmap.org/download.html#windows](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows)

_Enable: Add Nmap to PATH_

---

3. Install Npcap (required)

Download:
[https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/)

_Enable: WinPcap compatibility mode_

## Running the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

_The GUI should open._

## How the Scanner Works

The application performs a full Layer-2 → Layer-7 device discovery workflow using a combination of Scapy and Nmap.
Here’s the under-the-hood exact sequence:

---

1. ARP Sweep (Network Discovery)

When you enter an IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`), the tool sends a broadcast:

```
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff → ARP → Who has 192.168.1.X?
```

Every device that exists on that subnet responds with:

* Its IP address
* Its MAC address

This identifies all *alive* devices without sending any TCP/UDP traffic, meaning it's:

* Fast
* Low-noise
* Not blocked by firewalls

---

2. Device Table Population

Each responding device is immediately inserted into the GUI with:

* IP Address
* MAC Address
* Placeholder text: `Resolving OS…`

This makes the UI feel responsive even before OS detection finishes.

---

3. OS Fingerprinting via Nmap

For every discovered device, Nmap is invoked with:

```
-O --osscan-guess --fuzzy
```

Nmap analyzes:

* TCP/IP stack behavior
* Sequence prediction patterns
* Window size
* TTL characteristics
* Specific port responses

Then returns the best match:

```
"Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accuracy)"
"Windows 10 1607 – 21H2 (97% accuracy)"
"Apple iOS 15 – 16 (100% accuracy)"
"Fortinet Firewall (97% accuracy)"
```

This gives a high-accuracy OS fingerprint.

---

4. Real-Time UI Updates

As each fingerprint resolves, the row in the GUI updates *in place*:

* No freezing
* No blocking the main thread
* OS results appear one-by-one

The progress bar runs until all devices are processed.

---

5. Optional CSV Export

When the scan finishes, results can be exported:

```
IP Address, MAC Address, Operating System
192.168.1.116, 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8, Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accurate)
...
```

Perfect for documentation, inventory, or a portfolio showcase.

## Output Overview — What You Can Expect to See

When you run the Active Network & Fingerprint Scanner, the application performs two major actions:

### 1. ARP Sweep (Fast Device Discovery)

The scanner quickly identifies devices on your subnet using ARP broadcasting.

You will immediately start seeing rows populate with:

| IP Address    | MAC Address       | Operating System |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 192.168.1.113 | 90:8D:6E:56:15:10 | Resolving OS…    |
| 192.168.1.116 | 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8 | Resolving OS…    |

### 2. OS Fingerprinting (Slower / In-Depth)

For each discovered device, Nmap runs:

```
-O --osscan-guess --fuzzy
```

As results come in, the "Operating System" column updates in real-time:

| IP Address    | MAC Address       | Operating System                           |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 192.168.1.113 | 90:8D:6E:56:15:10 | Unknown                                    |
| 192.168.1.116 | 4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8 | Linux 3.2 – 4.14 (100% accurate)           |
| 192.168.1.123 | A0:85:FC:DD:98:6A | Fortinet FortiGate Firewall (97% accurate) |
| 192.168.1.152 | F0:EF:86:16:CF:C9 | Google Home device (100% accurate)         |

### Status Footer

At the bottom you get clear status updates:

```
Ready.
Scanning…
9 devices found • Scan completed in 14.2s
```

### CSV Export Output

Exporting results generates a clean CSV file:

```
IP Address,MAC Address,Operating System
192.168.1.113,90:8D:6E:56:15:10,Unknown
192.168.1.116,4C:BC:E9:51:1F:F8,Linux 3.2–4.14 (100% accurate)
192.168.1.123,A0:85:FC:DD:98:6A,Fortinet FortiGate Firewall (97% accurate)
```

### Expected Real-World Results

Depending on your network, the scanner will identify:

* Windows 10 / 11 machines
* macOS clients
* iOS & Android devices
* Routers & firewalls (e.g., FortiGate, UniFi, TP-Link)
* Smart home devices (Google Home, IoT, cameras)
* Linux servers or embedded OSes

OS detection accuracy varies. Some devices confidently report at 100%, others remain `"Unknown"` due to manufacturer restrictions or closed network stacks.
